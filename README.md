# Photography Portfolio Website

## Overview

Welcome to my photography portfolio website! This platform serves as a showcase for my photographic work, functioning both as a portfolio and a source of inspiration and professional tips for newcomers to the captivating world of photographyâ€”something I'm deeply passionate about.

## Design Principles

In crafting the website's design, I've adhered to key Gestalt Principles to enhance user experience:

- **Enclosure**: Objects enclosed within defined boundaries are perceived as a cohesive group.
  
- **Similarity**: Elements resembling each other are grouped together, creating a sense of coherence within the design.
  
- **Continuity**: Visual elements maintaining a consistent shape are perceived as a singular object, contributing to seamless visual flow.
  
- **Closure**: Utilizing closed groups of lines to form elements, encouraging completion with illusory lines for easier perception.
  
- **Connection**: Establishing visual connections between diverse elements to enhance the overall design cohesion.
  
- **Proximity**: Grouping visually diverse elements that are physically close to each other, promoting a unified perception.
  
- **Symmetry**: Utilizing symmetrical shapes for visual stimuli, ensuring easy recognition and perception as a cohesive object.

## Color Palette

I follow the 60-30-10 rule for the color scheme:

- **Dominant Color (60%)**: Sets the primary tone for the website.
  
- **Secondary Color (30%)**: Complements the dominant color, providing balance and variety.
  
- **Accent Color (10%)**: Adds highlights and emphasis.

### Color Selection

- **Analogous Colors**: Colors adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
  
- **Adjacent Complementary Colors**: Analogous colors of a color's complementary color, creating a high-contrast yet harmonious palette.

## Typography

For fonts, I employ a legible typeface with variations in size and color to enhance readability and visual appeal.

## Responsive Design with Flex
The website is designed to be responsive using the Flexbox layout. In the context of Tailwind CSS:

- **Flex Container**: Apply flex utility class to a container to enable flex properties.

- **Flex Direction**: Use flex-row, flex-col, flex-row-reverse, or flex-col-reverse for row or column-based layout.

- **Justify Content**: Utilize justify-start, justify-end, justify-center, justify-between, justify-around, or justify-evenly to control the alignment along the main axis.

- **Align Items**: Apply items-start, items-end, items-center, items-baseline, or items-stretch to control the alignment along the cross axis.

## Page Structure

1. **Home Page**: An entry point with a background image and informative sections, featuring an animated transition.

2. **Blog Page**: Offers valuable tips for enhancing images based on specific objectives.

3. **Gallery Section**: Displays galleries categorized for easy navigation, with potential enhancements using JavaScript.

4. **About Me and Project Page**: Provides insights into the creator, materials used, and other relevant information.

5. **Contact**: Offer a contact functional page. It work width the service [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). That is a free service for contact forms on static sites integrated in HTML.
